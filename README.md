# Goods Transportation Tracking Platform

## Introduction
This project is a scalable logistics platform designed for goods transportation. It enables customers to book transportation services, drivers to accept delivery requests, and admins to monitor operations and performance analytics. The platform supports up to 50 million users, 100,000 drivers, and handles up to 10,000 requests per second globally.

## High-Level Design (HLD)

### Client Architecture
- **Customer Section**: Allows users to book transportation, track packages, and view trip details.
- **Driver Section**: Lets drivers manage availability, view assigned jobs, and confirm trip completion.
- **Admin Section**: Provides a dashboard for system performance analytics and driver availability monitoring.

### Backend Architecture
- **API Gateway**: Manages authentication (JWT) and routes requests to respective services.
- **Node.js Server**: Handles bookings, user authentication, and real-time updates.
- **Database (MongoDB)**: Stores data for users, drivers, and bookings with horizontal scalability using NoSQL.
- **Redis**: Caches frequently accessed data like driver locations for faster performance.
- **Cloud Integration (AWS/Azure)**: Ensures global scalability, redundancy, and high availability.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSockets provide live updates for both customers and drivers.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling to handle increasing user and driver demand.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login and role-based access control using JWT.

## Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
The platform's data model consists of three main entities:

### USERS Table
- **Attributes**: `UserID`, `Email`, `FullName`, `PhoneNumber`, `IsAdmin`, `Password`, `RefreshToken`
- **Purpose**: Stores customer data and authentication details.
- **Relationships**: Each user can have multiple bookings.

### DRIVERS Table
- **Attributes**: `DriverID`, `Email`, `FullName`, `PhoneNumber`, `IsAvailable`, `VehicleDetails`, `LocationCoordinates`
- **Purpose**: Holds driver details and availability status.
- **Relationships**: Drivers are assigned multiple bookings.

### BOOKINGS Table
- **Attributes**: `BookingID`, `UserID`, `DriverID`, `PickupLocation`, `DropoffLocation`, `Price`, `Status`
- **Purpose**: Logs booking information and tracks package transportation.

## Features & Workflows

### User Workflow
1. **Login/Signup**: Users register or log in using credentials.
2. **Create Booking**: Enter pickup/drop-off locations, choose vehicle type, confirm booking, and track the package.
3. **Track Booking**: View real-time updates of driver location and package status.
4. **Complete Trip**: Users review service after package delivery.

### Driver Workflow
1. **Login/Signup**: Drivers register, log in, and manage availability.
2. **Job Assignment**: View and accept delivery requests based on availability and proximity.
3. **Complete Job**: Drivers confirm delivery and update availability.

### Admin Workflow
1. **Dashboard Access**: Admins monitor system performance and driver availability.
2. **Manage Users and Drivers**: Admins can add, modify, or remove users and drivers.
3. **Analytics**: View booking trends, average delivery times, and driver efficiency.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js for a responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for API handling and business logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing users, drivers, and bookings data.
- **Caching**: Redis for low-latency access to frequently used data.
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS or Azure for infrastructure scalability and global availability.

## Scalability and Performance
- **Horizontal Scaling**: The system can scale by adding more servers to handle increased load.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple servers to prevent overload.
- **Caching**: Redis optimizes response times by caching frequently accessed data.
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets provide real-time updates between users and drivers.

## Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: JWT is used for secure session management.
- **Data Encryption**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, and communication is encrypted via HTTPS.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different roles (user, driver, admin) have appropriate access levels.

## Conclusion
This logistics platform provides a scalable and efficient solution for global goods transportation, offering real-time updates, secure authentication, and robust performance. It is built to handle millions of users and ensure reliable package tracking in real-time, leveraging cloud infrastructure and modern technologies.
